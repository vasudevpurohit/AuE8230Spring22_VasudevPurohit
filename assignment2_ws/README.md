## Package included:
-tb_sim - TurtleBot simulator\

## Scripts included
-circle.py -- moves the turlebot in a circle with a constant twist velocity\
The linear velocity along x and angular velocity about z are input by the user.\

-square_openloop.py -- moves the turtlebot in a square using open loop control\
Here, the speed is hardcoded but can also be passed as an input by the user.\

-square_closedloop.py -- moves the turtlebot in a square using closed loop control\
The velocity is decided by a turtlebot_controller, that changes the linear and angular speed based on closeness to the goal pose. A time-based break has also been included to prevent the controller from giving infinitesimally small speed inputs to reach the goal pose.
